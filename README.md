## Overview

MONOREPO.VIZ is a frontend prototype for a next-generation visualization tool designed to help developers navigate complex monorepo architectures. By leveraging 3D force-directed graphs and AI-powered predictive analysis, it provides unprecedented clarity into dependency structures, build pathways, and potential conflict zones.

This "Luxe Edition" emphasizes not just functionality but a premium, immersive user experience with high-end aesthetics, smooth animations, and a responsive design.

**Note**: This is a frontend-only template with no backend functionality. It serves as a concept/prototype to demonstrate the potential UI/UX of the application.

## Features

-   **Molecular Mapping**: Interactive 3D visualization of codebase dependencies.
-   **Blast Radius Analysis**: Predict the impact of changes before committing.
-   **Neural Optimization**: AI-driven build path optimization suggestions.
-   **Conflict Oracle**: Machine learning capability to predict merge conflicts.
-   **Premium UI/UX**: Glassmorphism, neon energy accents, and fluid motion.

## Technology Stack

-   **Core**: HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) - Frontend only
-   **Styling**: Vanilla CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox, Grid, Keyframe Animations)
-   **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas / SVG for visualizations (Simulated in this prototype)
-   **Fonts**: 'JetBrains Mono', 'Orbitron', 'Space Grotesk' via Google Fonts
-   **Note**: This project contains only frontend code with no backend implementation

## Project Nature

This project is a frontend prototype/concept and does not represent a fully functional application. It is intended to showcase potential UI/UX designs and concepts for the MONOREPO.VIZ platform. All pages are static HTML with simulated functionality for demonstration purposes only.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you can use any static file server. Here are a few recommended methods:

### Option 1: Python (Built-in)
If you have Python installed:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Option 2: Node.js
If you prefer Node.js tools:
```bash
npx serve .
```

### Option 3: VS Code Live Server
Install the **Live Server** extension in VS Code and click "Go Live" in the status bar.

## Project Structure
