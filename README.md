## Overview

MONOREPO.VIZ is a next-generation visualization tool designed to help developers navigate complex monorepo architectures. By leveraging 3D force-directed graphs and AI-powered predictive analysis, it provides unprecedented clarity into dependency structures, build pathways, and potential conflict zones.

This "Luxe Edition" emphasizes not just functionality but a premium, immersive user experience with high-end aesthetics, smooth animations, and a responsive design.

## Features

-   **Molecular Mapping**: Interactive 3D visualization of codebase dependencies.
-   **Blast Radius Analysis**: Predict the impact of changes before committing.
-   **Neural Optimization**: AI-driven build path optimization suggestions.
-   **Conflict Oracle**: Machine learning capability to predict merge conflicts.
-   **Premium UI/UX**: Glassmorphism, neon energy accents, and fluid motion.

## Technology Stack

-   **Core**: HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
-   **Styling**: Vanilla CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox, Grid, Keyframe Animations)
-   **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas / SVG for visualizations (Simulated in this template)
-   **Fonts**: 'JetBrains Mono', 'Orbitron', 'Space Grotesk' via Google Fonts
